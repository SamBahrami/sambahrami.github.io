I am a PhD researcher in artificial intelligence and computer vision at the Australian National University. My supervisors are [Dylan Campbell](https://sites.google.com/view/djcampbell), [Stephen Gould](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/), and [Hongdong Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/). My research focuses on 3D reconstruction from limited data (creating 3D models from 2D images).

My [LinkedIn is here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sambahrami/), and my [GitHub is here](https://github.com/SamBahrami/).

I'm also involved in AI safety research, particularly evaluating large language models using [algorithmic information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory). I'm always interested in meeting new people and hearing about potential collaborations. If you'd like to get in touch with me, please email me at sam [dot] bahrami [at] anu [dot] edu [dot] au.
